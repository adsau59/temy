### What is Temy?

Do you keep a calculator near you when you start grinding for new temtems? Are you annoyed by adding SV everytime you catch a temtem just to check if it is even worth keeping it or not. If the answer of any of these questions are yes. I have just the app for you. 

Introducing Temtem Assistant, this is a small python script which will automtically read the SV from the game screen, calculate total SV and tell you via text to speech each time you capture a temtem, so that you can easily make a decision to either keep the temtem or release it immediately.

### Why?
- To make grinding for Temtems just a bit easier.

### What do I need?
Supbot is made using
- [Python 3.7.1](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-371/)
- [Espeak](http://sourceforge.net/projects/espeak/files/espeak/espeak-1.48/setup_espeak-1.48.04.exe)
- Windows 10
